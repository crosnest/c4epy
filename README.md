## To Install

```bash
pip3 install c4epy
```

## Getting Started

Below is a simple example for querying an account's balances:

```python
from c4epy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

# connect to Fetch.ai network using default parameters
ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.chain4energy_mainnet())

alice: str = 'c4e1t62t32vvkr78zdws3jvu9rxjkz3fy0ex4v7e7l'
balances = ledger_client.query_bank_all_balances(alice)

# show all coin balances
for coin in balances:
    print(f'{coin.amount}{coin.denom}')
```

## Documentation
